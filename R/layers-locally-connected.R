#' Locally-connected layer for 1D inputs.
#'
#' `layer_locally_connected_1d()` works similarly to [layer_conv_1d()] , except
#' that weights are unshared, that is, a different set of filters is applied at
#' each different patch of the input.
#'
#' @inheritParams layer_conv_2d
#'
#' @param filters Integer, the dimensionality of the output space (i.e. the
#'   number output of filters in the convolution).
#' @param kernel_size An integer or list of a single integer, specifying the
#'   length of the 1D convolution window.
#' @param strides An integer or list of a single integer, specifying the stride
#'   length of the convolution. Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible
#'   with specifying any `dilation_rate` value != 1.
#' @param padding Currently only supports `"valid"` (case-insensitive). `"same"`
#'   may be supported in the future.
#' @param implementation either 1, 2, or 3. 1 loops over input spatial locations
#'   to perform the forward pass. It is memory-efficient but performs a lot of
#'   (small) ops. 2 stores layer weights in a dense but sparsely-populated 2D
#'   matrix and implements the forward pass as a single matrix-multiply. It uses
#'   a lot of RAM but performs few (large) ops. 3 stores layer weights in a
#'   sparse tensor and implements the forward pass as a single sparse
#'   matrix-multiply. How to choose: 1: large, dense models, 2: small models, 3:
#'   large, sparse models, where "large" stands for large input/output
#'   activations (i.e. many `filters, input_filters, large input_size, output_size`),
#'   and "sparse" stands for few connections between inputs and outputs, i.e.
#'   small ratio `filters * input_filters * kernel_size / (input_size * strides)`,
#'   where inputs to and outputs of the layer are assumed to have shapes
#'   `(input_size, input_filters)`, `(output_size, filters)` respectively.
#'   It is recommended to benchmark each in the setting of interest to pick the
#'   most efficient one (in terms of speed and memory usage). Correct choice of
#'   implementation can lead to dramatic speed improvements (e.g. 50X),
#'   potentially at the expense of RAM. Also, only `padding="valid"` is
#'   supported by `implementation=1`.
