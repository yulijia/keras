\title{A preprocessing layer which randomly adjusts brightness during training}
\usage{
layer_random_brightness(
  object,
  factor,
  value_range = list(0L, 255L),
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{factor}{Float or a list of 2 floats between -1.0 and 1.0. The
factor is used to determine the lower bound and upper bound of the
brightness adjustment. A float value will be chosen randomly between
the limits. When -1.0 is chosen, the output image will be black, and
when 1.0 is chosen, the image will be fully white.
When only one float is provided, eg, 0.2,
then -0.2 will be used for lower bound and 0.2
will be used for upper bound.}

\item{value_range}{Optional list of 2 floats
for the lower and upper limit
of the values of the input data.
To make no change, use \link{0.0, 1.0}, e.g., if the image input
has been scaled before this layer. Defaults to \link{0.0, 255.0}.
The brightness adjustment will be scaled to this range, and the
output values will be clipped to this range.}

\item{seed}{optional integer, for fixed RNG behavior.}

\item{...}{standard layer arguments.}
}
\description{
A preprocessing layer which randomly adjusts brightness during training
}
\details{
This layer will randomly increase/reduce the brightness for the input RGB
images. At inference time, the output will be identical to the input.
Call the layer with \code{training=TRUE} to adjust the brightness of the input.

Note that different brightness adjustment factors
will be apply to each the images in the batch.
