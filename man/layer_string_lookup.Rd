  object,
  max_tokens = NULL,
  num_oov_indices = 1L,
  mask_token = NULL,
  oov_token = "[UNK]",
  vocabulary = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{max_tokens}{Maximum size of the vocabulary for this layer. This should
only be specified when adapting the vocabulary or when setting
\code{pad_to_max_tokens=TRUE}. If NULL, there is no cap on the size of the
vocabulary. Note that this size includes the OOV and mask tokens.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{num_oov_indices}{The number of out-of-vocabulary tokens to use. If this
value is more than 1, OOV inputs are hashed to determine their OOV
value. If this value is 0, OOV inputs will cause an error when calling
the layer.  Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{mask_token}{A token that represents masked inputs. When \code{output_mode} is
\code{"int"}, the token is included in vocabulary and mapped to index 0. In
other output modes, the token will not appear in the vocabulary and
instances of the mask token in the input will be dropped. If set to
NULL, no mask term will be added. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{oov_token}{Only used when \code{invert} is TRUE. The token to return for OOV
indices. Defaults to \code{"[UNK]"}.}

\item{vocabulary}{Optional. Either an array of strings or a string path to a
text file. If passing an array, can pass a list, list, 1D numpy array,
or 1D tensor containing the string vocbulary terms. If passing a file
path, the file should contain one line per term in the vocabulary. If
this argument is set, there is no need to \code{adapt()} the layer.}

\item{idf_weights}{Only valid when \code{output_mode} is \code{"tf_idf"}. A list, list,
1D numpy array, or 1D tensor or the same length as the vocabulary,
containing the floating point inverse document frequency weights, which
will be multiplied by per sample term counts for the final \code{tf_idf}
weight. If the \code{vocabulary} argument is set, and \code{output_mode} is
\code{"tf_idf"}, this argument must be supplied.}

\item{encoding}{Optional. The text encoding to use to interpret the input
strings. Defaults to \code{"utf-8"}.}

\item{invert}{Only valid when \code{output_mode} is \code{"int"}. If TRUE, this layer will
map indices to vocabulary items instead of mapping vocabulary items to
indices. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{output_mode}{Specification for the output of the layer. Values can be
\code{"int"}, \code{"one_hot"}, \code{"multi_hot"}, \code{"count"}, or \code{"tf_idf"}
configuring the layer as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{"int"}: Return the raw integer indices of the input tokens.
\item \code{"one_hot"}: Encodes each individual element in the input into an
array the same size as the vocabulary, containing a 1 at the element
index. If the last dimension is size 1, will encode on that
dimension. If the last dimension is not size 1, will append a new
dimension for the encoded output.
\item \code{"multi_hot"}: Encodes each sample in the input into a single array
the same size as the vocabulary, containing a 1 for each vocabulary
term present in the sample. Treats the last dimension as the sample
dimension, if input shape is (..., sample_length), output shape will
be (..., num_tokens).
\item \code{"count"}: As \code{"multi_hot"}, but the int array contains a count of
the number of times the token at that index appeared in the sample.
\item \code{"tf_idf"}: As \code{"multi_hot"}, but the TF-IDF algorithm is applied to
find the value in each token slot.
For \code{"int"} output, any shape of input and output is supported. For all
other output modes, currently only output up to rank 2 is supported.
Defaults to \code{"int"}
}}

\item{sparse}{Boolean. Only applicable when \code{output_mode} is \code{"multi_hot"},
\code{"count"}, or \code{"tf_idf"}. If TRUE, returns a \code{SparseTensor} instead of a
dense \code{Tensor}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{pad_to_max_tokens}{Only applicable when \code{output_mode} is \code{"multi_hot"},
\code{"count"}, or \code{"tf_idf"}. If TRUE, the output will have its feature axis
padded to \code{max_tokens} even if the number of unique tokens in the
vocabulary is less than max_tokens, resulting in a tensor of shape
\link{batch_size, max_tokens} regardless of vocabulary size. Defaults to
FALSE.}

\item{...}{standard layer arguments.}

\description{
A preprocessing layer which maps string features to integer indices
}
\details{
This layer translates a set of arbitrary strings into integer output via a
table-based vocabulary lookup. This layer will perform no splitting or
transformation of input strings. For a layer than can split and tokenize
natural language, see the \code{tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization} layer.

The vocabulary for the layer must be either supplied on construction or
learned via \code{adapt()}. During \code{adapt()}, the layer will analyze a data set,
determine the frequency of individual strings tokens, and create a
vocabulary from them. If the vocabulary is capped in size, the most frequent
tokens will be used to create the vocabulary and all others will be treated
as out-of-vocabulary (OOV).

There are two possible output modes for the layer.
When \code{output_mode} is \code{"int"},
input strings are converted to their index in the vocabulary (an integer).
When \code{output_mode} is \code{"multi_hot"}, \code{"count"}, or \code{"tf_idf"}, input strings
are encoded into an array where each dimension corresponds to an element in
the vocabulary.

The vocabulary can optionally contain a mask token as well as an OOV token
(which can optionally occupy multiple indices in the vocabulary, as set
by \code{num_oov_indices}).
The position of these tokens in the vocabulary is fixed. When \code{output_mode}
is \code{"int"}, the vocabulary will begin with the mask token (if set), followed
by OOV indices, followed by the rest of the vocabulary. When \code{output_mode}
is \code{"multi_hot"}, \code{"count"}, or \code{"tf_idf"} the vocabulary will begin with
OOV indices and instances of the mask token will be dropped.
