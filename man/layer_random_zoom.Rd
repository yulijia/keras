\title{A preprocessing layer which randomly zooms images during training}
\usage{
layer_random_zoom(
  object,
  height_factor,
  width_factor = NULL,
  fill_mode = "reflect",
  interpolation = "bilinear",
  seed = NULL,
  fill_value = 0,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{height_factor}{a float represented as fraction of value,
or a list of size 2 representing lower and upper bound
for zooming vertically. When represented as a single float,
this value is used for both the upper and
lower bound. A positive value means zooming out,
while a negative value
means zooming in. For instance, \verb{height_factor=(0.2, 0.3)}
result in an output zoomed out by a random amount
in the range \verb{[+20\%, +30\%]}.
\verb{height_factor=(-0.3, -0.2)} result in an output zoomed
in by a random amount in the range \verb{[+20\%, +30\%]}.}

\item{width_factor}{a float represented as fraction of value,
or a list of size 2 representing lower and upper bound
for zooming horizontally. When
represented as a single float, this value is used
for both the upper and
lower bound. For instance, \verb{width_factor=(0.2, 0.3)}
result in an output
zooming out between 20\% to 30\%.
\verb{width_factor=(-0.3, -0.2)} result in an
output zooming in between 20\% to 30\%. \code{NULL} means
i.e., zooming vertical and horizontal directions
by preserving the aspect ratio. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{fill_mode}{Points outside the boundaries of the input are
filled according to the given mode
(one of \verb{\{"constant", "reflect", "wrap", "nearest"\}}).
\itemize{
\item \emph{reflect}: \verb{(d c b a | a b c d | d c b a)}
The input is extended by reflecting about
the edge of the last pixel.
\item \emph{constant}: \verb{(k k k k | a b c d | k k k k)}
The input is extended by filling all values beyond
the edge with the same constant value k = 0.
\item \emph{wrap}: \verb{(a b c d | a b c d | a b c d)} The input is extended by
wrapping around to the opposite edge.
\item \emph{nearest}: \verb{(a a a a | a b c d | d d d d)}
The input is extended by the nearest pixel.
}}

\item{interpolation}{Interpolation mode. Supported values: \code{"nearest"},
\code{"bilinear"}.}

\item{seed}{Integer. Used to create a random seed.}

\item{fill_value}{a float represents the value to be filled outside
the boundaries when \code{fill_mode="constant"}.}

\item{...}{standard layer arguments.}
}
\description{
A preprocessing layer which randomly zooms images during training
}
\details{
This layer will randomly zoom in or out on each axis of an image
independently, filling empty space according to \code{fill_mode}.

Input pixel values can be of any range (e.g. \verb{[0., 1.)} or \verb{[0, 255]}) and
of integer or floating point dtype.
By default, the layer will output floats.
